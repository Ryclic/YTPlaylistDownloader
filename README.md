# YT Playlist Downloader

This is a very simple script meant for downloading audio from Youtube playlists. You can add any audio or song to an **unlisted or public playlist**, and run the script with the playlist link to scrape the MP3 files. The new files are generated in a directory called "songs".

Included is a batch script for more convenient use of the script. Replace the first field with the directory of your Python executable, and the second field with the directory that the script is in.


*Note: This script may break in the future due to instability issues with PyTube*
